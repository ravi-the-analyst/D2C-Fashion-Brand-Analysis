# 📊 D2C Fashion Brand Analysis

## The Story

A D2C fashion brand was facing a **critical problem**: a 55.2% return rate during Q4 2024 that was eating into profits. Was it a product quality issue? A customer satisfaction problem? Or something else entirely?

Through deep-dive data analysis of 346 orders (₹1M+ in GMV), I uncovered the real culprit: **not the products, but the buyers and the sales channels.**

## 🎯 The Problem I Solved

**The Challenge:**  
- Why do NEW customers return items 14.6% more often than returning customers?
- Why does Instagram Shop (their fastest-growing channel) have a 67.6% return rate?
- Why is COD payment the riskiest method with 84.4% returns?

**The Discovery:**  
The problem wasn't product quality—it was **size fit confusion + risky customer segments + high-risk payment channels**.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: The return rate is high. Is it a product problem?**  
A: No. Returns are driven by NEW customers (first-time buyers are exploratory) buying through Instagram/COD, combined with size fit confusion. The brand itself is fine.

**Q: Should we close Instagram Shop?**  
A: No! It generates ₹335K revenue. Instead, optimize it: improve sizing creatives, restrict COD, push low-return categories.

**Q: What's the single biggest lever to pull?**  
A: **Improve size communication.** 45% of returns cite "Size Issue"—this is fixable without hurting sales.

**Q: How fast can we see results?**  
A: Size guides can be implemented in 2–3 weeks. Monitor for 2–3 weeks post-implementation to see return rate impact.
